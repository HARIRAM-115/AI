# Hi there👋
This is the Computer Vision project using python with the opencv library and Haarcascade Algorithm ##Library and Algorithm💻 -The project needs python IDLE with the standard version of 3.9.6 -Install the following libarary using the "pip install -----" command in cmd Libraries📚 : -OpenCV -Mediapipe(Handgesture) -OS(inbuilt library to fetch the dataset) -numpy Algorithm📃: -HaarcascadeFrontalFaceAlgorithm ##Realtime example🌍: -Face Locking System(mobile) -Robotics(Handgesture) ##Steps to run the FaceRecoginitionProject☺️: -Open the program Named as facerecstore.py -Enter the name at where the name 'AbdulKalam' is placed -Run the program -Now,the camera of your Computer is tracked and Scanning for the Face to Create the new DataSet -When the face Recognized the camera.it take upto 50 images and save it to the folder named as Dataset -After that open the program named as faceRecognition.py and run it -it fetch the dataset by training and scanning for the face.when the face recognized.it label the face according to the dataset with their conflict value. -the prediction is upto 85%. ##Step to HandGesture Project🤚: -open the program named as HandGesture.py -run the program -it recognize your hand and plot the point and join the edges. -it the simple project to recognize your hand.if we need to do an addition operation.we can do it using this program
